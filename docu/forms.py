            When a user modifies a widget's value, the Python script will be rerun. If you have a small app, this will not cause much issues, but for a large and complex app, this rerun behavior may make it much less efficient. Furthermore, if an app depends on a set of input rather than individual pieces, it may be more convenient to bundle them together.
         
            In this situation, you can use a Form (`st.form()`) to group elements and widgets together. Any input passed to the form will only be sent to the server once the submit button is pressed. Note that each form must have a form submit button (`st.form_submit_button()`).
